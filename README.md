# wh_model
Algorithm used in the development of a method for estimating weight and height from multi-view images of an individual. The code supports both training and inference based on provided examples

## üìã Tools

* Python 3.10
* Cuda 11.7
* Conda 23.3

### How to use

* First, download the Anaconda tool from the distributor's website.
```
https://www.anaconda.com/about-us
```

* Create a virtual environment from the file according to the project specifications.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


* To download the project, clone it directly from git by executing the following command:

```


```
If not, go into the `cmad` folder
```
cd mad

```


| Atention: If you use a virtual environment, make sure it is activated!  <br/> If you have any questions, go to [link](https://www.treinaweb.com.br/blog/criando-ambientes-virtuais-para-projetos-python-com-o-virtualenv) |
